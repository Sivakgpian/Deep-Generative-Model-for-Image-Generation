# Deep-Generative-Model-for-Image-Generation

Trained VAE on 512x512 AnimalFaces images that minimize both MSE loss and KL divergence, yielding high-quality
image generation. Learned latents provided robust feature representations, achieving 92% test accuracy when used in an
MLP for the classification of animals.
